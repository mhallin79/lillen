# Review Templates

## Single hirer

### Template 1 
**[Name]** was very good to hire to. He has experience driving large vehicles 
which gave me a sense of ease.
He was esay to deal with and returned the van in great condition. 
I would not hesitate to hire my van to him again and would recommend 
him to other owners as a hirer.

### Template 2
Dealing with **[Name]** was an absolute pleasure. 
Very friendly and easy to communicate with. 
I would gladly hire my van to him again.

## Family hirers

### Template 1 
**[Name]** rented Lillen with his family and they are wonderful guests! 
I would highly recommend them to future owners as they returned our van super clean. 
I be happy to rent out Lillen to **[Name]** and his family again anytime!

### Template 2 
**[Name]** looked after our Lillen with silver gloves, and I think they might actually have returned
it in a better condition than it was picked up in. I would highly recommend them to future owners 
and I be very happy to rent out Lillen to them again anytime!
