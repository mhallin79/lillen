# Electric Bed
In the unfortunate event that the bed has stopped working please follow these 3 steps.

## House Power Enabled
First check that button 1 and 2 on the Battery and Water Control Panel are turned on.

## Electrical Cable Connectors
Secondary, check that the electrical cables that hang down on the inside of the storage hatch
on the left rear side are properly connected. It’s easy to accidentally knock them out when
removing the camping chairs and other large objects.

## Fuse Box
If the cables are properly connected, the next place to check is the fuse box that is located
under the passenger couch behind the driver seat. There is a Spare Fuses Kit inside the storage
hatch at the rear on the right side (where the water hoses are stored).

## Manual Operation
According to the electric bed manual, there is an option for manual operation of the bed. It is a
two-man job and it seem to be a complicated procedure. **Do not attempt this without first
contacting the owner or Camplify support.**
