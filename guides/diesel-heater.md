# Diesel Heater
Lillen is equipped with a diesel heater for use while the vehicle is stationary,
the diesel heater unit not only warms the RV's interior but also dehumidifies for complete comfort. 

In normal operation, the heater would use approximately **1 litre of diesel fuel** every 5-6 hours and is 
using the vehicle's normal diesel tank.

## Rotary Control
The diesel heater Rotary Control is located at the back of the motorhome on the left side next to the [hot water heater controls](hot-water-system.md).

### Start-up Sequence
The glow plug and the combustion air fan start the operation and combustion process 
(audible combustion sound of the combustion air fan and the ticking of the fuel pump will be noticeable). The fuel will be delivered and the combustion air fan speed will accelerate and provide hot air.

### Switching Off
When heating is no longer required, switch the heater off by the means of the controller on the heater.

The combustion will be extinguished, followed by a shutdown cooling cycle.
