# 15A to 10A Power Adaptor
Lillen comes equiped with a weatherproof 15A to 10A power adaptor. 
It safely and legally connects the 15A power cable to 10A power point.

Generally if you book a powered site at a caravan park it will be equipped with a 15A power point. 

However, if you are taking Lillen to stay at someones property they might only have 10A power points.
