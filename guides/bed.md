# Electric Bed
In the unfortunate event that the bed has stopped working please follow these 3 steps.

## Step 1 - House Power Enabled 
First check that button 1 and 2 on the [Battery and Water Control Panel](control-panel.md) are turned on.

## Step 2 - Electrical Cable Connectors
Second, check that the electrical cables that hang down on the inside of the storage 
hatch on the left rear side are properly connected. It's easy to accidentally knock them out 
when removing the camping chairs and other large objects.

## Step 3 - Fuse Box
If the cables are properly connected, the next place to check is the fuse box that is located 
under the passenger couch behind the driver seat. There is a Spare Fuses Kit inside the storage 
hatch at the rear on the right side (where the water hoses are stored). 

## Manual Operation
According to the electric bed manual, there is an option for manual operation of the bed. 
It is a two-man job and it seem to be a complicated procedure. 

> **Important!** Do not attempt manual operation without first contacting the owner or Camplify support.
