# Diesel Heater Control
Lillen is equipped with a diesel heater for those cold winter months. It is using the same diesel fuel tank 
as the Fiat engine. 

The diesel heater control is a dial that is located at the back of the motorhome on the left side next 
to the [hot water heater controls](hot-water-heater-controls.md).

To turn the heater on, simply turn the dial anti clockwise to the desired level.
Hot air will then blow out from under the wardrobe.
