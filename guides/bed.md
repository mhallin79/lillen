# Electric Bed
In the unfortunate event that the bed has stopped working please follow these 3 steps.

## Step 1 - House Power Enabled 
First check that button 1 and 2 on the [Battery and Water Control Panel](control-panel.md) are turned on.

## Step 2 - Electrical Cable Connectors
Second, check that the electrical cables that hang down on the inside of the storage 
hatch on the left rear side are properly connected. It's easy to accidentally knock them out 
when removing the camping chairs and other large objects.

## Step 3 - Fuse Box
If the cables are properly connected, the next place to check is the fuse box that is located 
under the passenger couch behind the driver seat. There is a Spare Fuses Kit inside the storage 
hatch at the rear on the right side (where the water hoses are stored). 

## Check 12V Power
If the bed will not raise when using 12V, check the power level of the "house battery" on 
the [Battery and Water Control Panel](../guides/control-panel.md).

If the battery level is between 11.0 and 12.2 e.g red and amber lights there might not be enough 
power to lift the bed back up. 

Example of low power
![low-power](images/control-panel-low-12v-power.png)

1. Ensure the battery indicator is lit green
2. Endure the AUX indicator is lit green
3. Press the battery switch down for House battery status
4. If the battery level is amber or red there might not be sufficient battery power left to raise the bed back up

### Charge the 12V battery
Turn off anything that is not essential and wait for the solar panels to charge the battery. 

> Ensure that the rooftop solar panels are not covered by shade.

Alternatively, find a 240V power source (service station etc) using the <a href="../guides/power-adaptor.html">15A to 10A Power Adaptor</a> 
if required and raise the bed whilst connected to external power.

## Manual Operation
According to the electric bed manual, there is an option for manual operation of the bed. 
It is a two-man job and it seem to be a complicated procedure. 

> **Important!** Do not attempt manual operation without first contacting the owner or Camplify support.
