# Fridge
Lillen has a 3-way refrigerator that has 3 modes of operation.

### 240V electricity
Use mains power if connected to external power.

### LPG gas.
Use LPG gas if there is no access to external power.

### 12V electricity
12v will only operate whilst driving. 

### Fans
There are two fans at the rear of the refrigerator to improve the cooling performance in high temperatures. It helps to 
detract the warm air quicker to the vents. 

Fan level 1 is to be used at ambient temperatures above 32°C
Fan level 2 is to be used at ambient temperatures above 38°C

> **Please note!** If using LPG gas, it can take up to **20 minutes** before the fridge turns on. 
>
> The refrigerator must be level and will not operate if not parked on a flat surface.
