    <strong>Tip:</strong> Running both the gas and the electric at the same time will heat the water quicker.

### Electric
When connected to 240V external power use the left electric button. The whole button is lit when the hot water heater is operating on 240V.

It will reach a usable temperature in approximately 40 minutes and **full temperature in 1 hour**.


### Gas
Turn on the gas switch and the  light will flash rapidly until the gas lights. 

The light will then remain constant, If the gas fails to light or the gas bottle has 
been changed the system may have air in the line so the it is designed to repeat three times to
ensure that the flame sensor monitors the gas correctly. 

If the gas fails or it senses a fault in the system it will turn off the gas and the
light will flash at a constant rate until the switch is turned off to reset the unit.

## Manual
The manufacturers operating instructions is available as a [PDF download](/docs/hot-water-system.pdf).
