# Nitrogen Tyre Inflation
Lillen's tyres have been inflated with nitrogen for increased tyre performance and better fuel economy. 
This is identified by the red coloured valve cap.

If a top up is required and you are unable to find a workshop that offers nitrogen, air can be used but 
let the owner know upon return of the vehicle as the tyre will need to be fully deflated and refilled 
with nitrogen.
