# Diesel Heater
Lillen is equipped with a diesel heater for use while the vehicle is stationary,
the diesel heater unit not only warms the RV's interior but also dehumidifies for complete comfort. 

In normal operation, the heater would use approximately **1 litre of diesel fuel** every 5-6 hours and is 
using the vehicle's normal diesel tank.

The diesel heater control is a dial that is located at the back of the motorhome on the left side next 
to the [hot water heater controls](hot-water-system.md).

To turn the heater on, simply turn the dial anti clockwise to the desired level.

Hot air will then blow out from under the wardrobe.
