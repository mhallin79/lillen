Generally, if you book a powered site at a caravan park it will be equipped with a 15A power point. 

However, if you are taking Lillen to stay at someones property they might only have 10A power points.

All water hose and power cable carrier bags are stored inside the right side rear storage 
compartment together with the weatherproof 15A to 10A power adaptor.
